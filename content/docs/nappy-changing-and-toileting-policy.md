**Rationale:** (why do we need this policy?)

To ensure that nappy changing/toileting are positive experiences: in which diversity and family practices are considered and in which children feel respected and are empowered to contribute to their own routines. To ensure that children, teachers, and others are kept safe and good hygiene practices are maintained during nappy changing and toileting routines.

**Objectives:** (What do we hope to achieve?)

To ensure children’s emotional wellbeing is paramount by treating children with dignity.

To minimize the risks, and spread of infectious diseases, between members of our community and beyond, by ensuring hygienic toileting, nappy changing and bathroom practices are followed.

To keep children, whānau and teachers safe by providing mindful supervision and clear responsibilities for practice.

To promote nappy changing and toileting rituals as valuable opportunities for children’s learning, in which parent/caregivers and teachers collaborate to create effective outcomes for children.

**Guidelines:** (How will we achieve it?)

Design, construction, and location of facilities

* The nappy change/toileting facilities are designed and maintained in a way that facilitates adequate supervision, having regard to the need to maintain the rights and dignity of the children.

* To prevent the spread of infection, the facilities are located in a designated area, near to hand washing facilities, and are adequately separated from areas used for play or food preparation,

* The nappy changing bench is of stable construction, the surface is comfortable, easily cleaned, and waterproof.

It is designed to minimise the possibility of falls and to promote children’s agency.

* The nappy change area should be fully stocked with all required materials at all times. Supplies must be accessible to adults to ensure efficiency, and the safety of each child.

Dignity and respect

* Teachers should discuss children’s individual needs with families to ensure practices are in harmony with child’s home environment and are culturally sensitive.

* Information is recorded and available regarding children’s nappy change/toileting patterns.

* Nappy changing and toileting reflect children’s individual care needs. Care experiences are unhurried and time is given for children to practise their developing self-help and self-care skills.

Safe and hygienic practices

* Change bench is maintain in good order with no tears to fabric.

* Procedures are documented and clearly displayed for nappy changing, toileting, bathing soiled children and washing hands. They are consistently followed and reviewed regularly to ensure the ongoing health and safety of children, whānau and teachers.
