**Rationale:** (why do we need this policy?)

All possible preparations and precautions must be taken to ensure the safety, protection, and care of children, staff and visitors present in the centre in the event of a civil defence, fire, earthquake, tsunami, or trespasser or violent intruder emergency.

**Objectives:** (What do we hope to achieve?)

To appoint authority to Senior Teacher (or Person Responsible) in the event of an emergency.
To inform all parties (parents, children, teachers, visitors) of the guidelines and processes in place for preparation, response and
recovery for both civil defence and other emergencies.

**Guidelines:** (How will we achieve it?)

Have an emergency plan in place that has been created in alliance with the relevant local authorities. That covers how to
* Prepare for emergencies
* Procedures covering how to respond to civil defence, fire, tsunami, earthquake, and trespasser or violent intruder emergencies. Procedures will be displayed on the wall at all times. Fire Action Plans are to be located in every room beside every exit door, on the notice board, and above the table with the sign in/out book, and next to all manual call
points. Exits will be clearly marked.
* Recovery response
  - Emergency Kits: Ensure sufficient and regularly maintained emergency kits on premises to provide emergency
supplies for support of children and staff for up to 72 hours.

  - Communication: The crèche has procedures in place so that in an emergency, whether at crèche or after leaving the premises, there is up to date contact information for caregivers and emergency contacts and a known communication plan.
  - Accounting for and releasing children: There are procedures for releasing children to parents and nominated emergency contacts in an emergency. Crèche will keep accurate record of who is under their care and/or on their premises at all times
  - Training: Teachers and children are trained in fire, earthquake and tsunami drills and other emergency procedures.
Accurate records of drills are documented.
  - First Aid: At all times, all teaching staff will hold a current first aid certificate. Opportunities for training and refresher courses will be made available.
  - Informing others: Parents and site visitors are kept informed about Civil Defence and Emergency policies and procedures where relevant.
