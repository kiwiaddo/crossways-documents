**Rationale:** (Why do we need this policy?)

The collaboration between whanau, child, and teacher is at the heart of Crossways Community Crèche Early Learning Centre. We believe children grow, learn, and flourish when learning is embedded within a culture of collaboration.  To honour the principle “Children’s family and community are an integral part of the learning community” (Te Whariki), we strive to ensure that families can be involved in all aspects of our programme. Parent help days are a treasured way families can effectively contribute to the learning curriculum and successful operation of the centre.  

**Objectives:** (What do we hope to achieve?)

To work in collaboration with parents to enrich children's learning experiences and environments.

To complement the role of family in children’s lives, working in partnership and building relationships of trust and mutual respect that nurture our learning community.

To provide a resource of time, experience, knowledge, and skills for our learning community to draw on to enhance learning and living in this place. 
To ensure that the adults in children’s lives at the centre understand the roles, responsibilities and routines.

To provide consistent experiences for children from the adults who support them.

**Guidelines:** (How will we achieve it?)

_Who can do parent help?_

We prefer that if possible a parent attends parent help but a close family member or child’s guardian on the day, e.g. a nanny, are welcome to attend.  Parents are asked to let the teachers know who to expect at the session if it will not be the parent. 

_How are parent help days organised?_

Every 5 to 6 weeks parents will be asked by the Parent Liaison Officer to give 3 possible dates on which they can attend. The schedule for the next 6 weeks is circulated to all families via email.

_Which days can be proposed as parent help days?_

Any day of the week can be nominated as parent help days, including days the child does not usually attend creche. If parent help falls on a child’s non-creche day, the child can attend creche for free. 

_What if a parent is unable to attend on their allocated day?_

If the parent is unable to attend parent help on their allocated day due to unforeseen circumstances such as emergency or illness, teachers should be notified as soon as possible.

If the parent is no longer able to attend on the allocated day, it is their responsibility to find a replacement. The parent simply needs to email the other families asking if anyone can swap days with them. This is usually very effective even if the email is sent the night before.  Again, please notify the teachers of all changes.

If the designated parent help fails to fulfil their commitment a $40 penalty will be incurred, except in the case of emergency. It may be possible to defer the fee by contributing to a maintenance or management task outside of the session times.  

_What if the parent help has another child to look after during their parent help session?_

Sometimes the parent may have a younger child to care for during their parent help session. If that is the case, the younger child’s needs should always come first and parents are encouraged to cut the day short and head home if needed.

_What if the child finds it difficult to settle with their parent at creche?_

It is not uncommmon for children to find it hard to share their parent with others on parent help day. If that is the case, parents are advised not to worry, and to consider cutting the day short if it becomes too stressful for child or parent. There will be future opportunities for the child to become accustomed to their parent’s presence.
 
*Parent Help Role and Responsibilities:*

Parent help provides a welcome extra pair of eyes to notice and respond to children’s learning. However, they are not considered as part of the centre’s ratios, so are not left alone with children. A teacher should always be within sight and available to help deal with conflicts, and issues of safety or uncertainty.

_Procedure on the Day_

Please see the document “Parent Help Procedures on the Day”, provided as an addendum to this policy, for information about this. 

_Respectful Interactions with Children_

Irrespective of special needs, gender, race or cultural, religious or family circumstances, children have a right to: 
* be treated with respect and to be protected from harm
* be asked to express their views and wishes about matters affecting their lives and to have those views appropriately considered by adults
* feel and be safe in their interactions with adults and other children 

An important part of every day is promoting positive, respectful interactions. Children are learning about their rights and responsibilities as part of the group and conflicts do occur. In these situations children are given time to find solutions but staff remain close at hand and if needed facilitate children reaching positive outcomes. Most often stating each child’s position helps children see the other point of view and they can then find their own solution eg “Manu is playing with the truck and Yaya I see you want to play with the truck too. I wonder what we can do?”  The most meaningful learning happens when children are supported to find their own solutions. 

If there seems to be a risk of physical or emotional harm staff promptly intervene to prevent and protect. Intimidating interactions between children such as shouting, pushing, kicking, biting, name calling, exclusion of others etc require a teacher’s attention and the parent help can valuably alert staff to these issues. 

_Health and Safety_

Health and Safety checks are completed each day. However the parent help may notice areas of concern and are asked to report these to staff so that they are able to address them. 

_Emergency Evacuation_

The parent help should make themselves familiar with the evacuation procedures (there are signposts outlining these in each room), the  locations  of the  emergency exit doors and the meeting place outside by the north wall.   

_Nappies and Toileting_

The teachers are responsible for meeting children’s intimate needs (unless it is the parent’s own child). All bathing, nappy and toilet needs should be referred to a staff member. 

_Dealing with Injuries_

All teachers are qualified first aiders and accidents should be referred to them. If the parent help is present when an accident happens, they will be asked about the circumstances so that they can be recorded in an accident report. 

_Privacy_

It is requested that photographs are not taken either using cameras or phones during session times, out of respect for the privacy of children and other adults attending that day. In addition, it is asked that information shared about the children to support their learning and lives at the centre be treated confidentially. The same applies to stories that the children share about their home lives, especially where the information might not usually be discussed openly by the family.   

_Welcoming Others_

An important role of parent help is welcoming new families and visitors who are looking at the centre as a potential place for their child to attend. Sharing first-hand experiences can be valuable to parents trying to evaluate and choose a centre.
