**Objectives:** (What do we hope to achieve?)
It is the Commitee’s commitment and capability to implement human resource management practices that will recruit, manage and develop competent staff, as the ongoing quality of the staff engaging with and educating children is important in a quality service.

**Guidelines:** (How will we achieve it?)


PART 1:  RULES AND POLICIES
These rules have been prepared to help answer some of the questions new and existing staff may have about the rules under which we must operate so that everyone is treated fairly.

Absenteeism:	

Any Employee who for any reason finds they are unable to attend work must contact the crèche or a co-worker as soon as possible stating the reason for their absence and the anticipated date of their return.

Attitude:	

Staff attitude is of paramount importance and must be of the highest quality at all times. 

Negative attitudes will be questioned and harmful attitudes affecting the work environment of work mates and children will result in warnings being issued.

Accidents:	

All accidents must immediately be reported to the supervisor and recorded in the Accident Register. 

A first aid kit is available for minor accidents. 

Staff must abide by the workplace procedure and policy.

Company Property:	

Any clothing, equipment, toys and tools of safety equipment, remain the property of the Creche and must be returned before uplifting your final pay prior to leaving the Creche. 

Honesty:	

The Creche demands absolute honesty. Any Employee found to be dishonest with a co-worker, parent, prospective parent or the creche in any manner will face strict disciplinary action or instant dismissal.

Personal Property:	

The creche does not accept any liability for personal property brought into the workplace.

Safety:	

Employees benefit from their observance of the safety rules. Employees are required to stay alert to situations that might be dangerous to themselves, fellow workers and the children in their care. 

All litter is to be deposited in the correct bins for removal. Floors should be kept clean.  

Any hazard that cannot be eliminated by an employee should be brought to the attention of the supervisor. Tools and equipment should be used properly, maintained in good working order and stored in their proper place when finished with. Irresponsible behaviour that may cause a dangerous situation should be eliminated. 

Sexual Harassment:	

Under the Employment Relations Act 2000 it is an offence for any person to sexually harass another, by the use of words or by physical behaviour. 

In the event of any complaint, the Employee will immediately provide the Creche with full details, in writing if required.

Any proven sexual harassment may result in dismissal.

Smoking:	

Under the Smoke Free Environment Act certain areas are totally smoke free. All staff and visitors must comply with these restrictions. Smoking is not allowed on any part of the creche premises or grounds. 

Standard of Dress:	

An acceptable standard of dress and personal hygiene is required.

Technological Change:	

The methods used to perform certain tasks are changing constantly and the creche reserves the right to introduce new work methods or equipment from time to time.

Timekeeping:	

As part of a team, Employees are expected to commence work at the time specified in their employment agreements. 

Employees are to complete all time and work records as required.

Time off:	

Appointments with doctors, dentists, etc. should be made, wherever possible, outside of the Employee’s normal working hours. However, if an appointment has to be made during normal working hours then permission for time off must be obtained prior to making the appointment.

PART 2:  APPOINTMENT AND EMPLOYMENT PROCEDURES 


For the hiring of teaching staff an interview panel will be made up of three members of the committee viz. the creche co-ordinator, supervisor and staff liaison or any other member of the committee co-opted for this purpose.  Care will be taken to avoid any conflict of interest (or any perception thereof) in the selection of the interview panel.  

All documentation provided by an applicant will be handled in a confidential manner.  

Interviewees will be entitled to bring whanau support to an interview. 

Appointments will be made by the full management committee on the recommendation of the interview panel.  

All new staff will be provided with an induction pack.  

All staff will have a job description. 

All employees will have an annual appraisal, conducted by the Crèche Co-ordinator and the Staff Liaison officer.  This process will include a review of job descriptions.  

All reasonable steps will be taken to provide staff employed or engaged in Crossways Community Crèche with adequate professional support, professional development opportunities and resources.  

PART 3:  DISCIPLINARY PROCEDURES

Where there is an allegation of misconduct (other than serious misconduct) the following procedures shall be observed:

* Before any form of disciplinary action is taken, an appointed representative of the crèche (the ‘Representative’) will promptly hold an investigation into the alleged misconduct and write to the employee to advise them of the nature of the complaint and that the disciplinary procedure in their Collective Agreement and this Policy is being followed.
* The Employer shall seek to resolve the complaint by discussion between the Employee and Employer in the first instance.  Employees may seek whanau, family, professional and / or NZEI support (if relevant) in relation to such matters.
* After allowing reasonable time for the situation to be resolved, where the Employer has reason to believe their have been more than one instance of the complaint(s) or feels the complaint is sufficiently serious, the Employer shall:
* Advise the Employee in writing of the incident(s);
* Allow the Employee reasonable time to contact a union representative to discuss the allegations made (if Employee is covered by a Collective Agreement);
* Meet with the Employee (and a union representative if relevant) to discuss the complaint(s) and give proper consideration to the Employee’s side of the story. 
* In the event that the Representative finds that misconduct has occurred the Employee will have the right to be heard in relation to the appropriate penalty before any decision as to penalty is made.

In the event that the Crèche decides to issue a warning, it will be formally issued in writing. Warnings are not to be limited to repetitions of the same or similar offences, but may be applied to offences of a different nature. The absence of a prior warning will not (depending on the seriousness of the conduct) preclude a dismissal.

Where there are issues of performance, the employer shall advise the Employee of the concerns in writing and appropriate assistance will be offered to the Employee in accordance with the Employee’s Collective Agreement ‘Competency’ procedures if Employee is covered by a Collective Agreement. Reasonable and fair opportunities will be given to improve and, if there is no improvement, then performance will be dealt with as a matter of discipline and the same procedures for misconduct matters will apply.

Suspension

Where circumstances warrant it, the crèche has the discretion to temporarily suspend the Employee from his or her duties prior to a full investigation of the allegations surrounding the circumstances involving the Employee. The Employee will be paid his or her normal wages while he or she is suspended, unless the period becomes protracted as a result of undue delay caused by the Employee, in which case the Crèche will be alleviated from its obligation to continue to pay remuneration.

Serious Misconduct

Serious misconduct by an Employee may give rise to summary dismissal.  In this situation, no notice period will be given to the Employee by the Creche. Conduct that may give rise to summary dismissal includes (but is not limited to):

* Unauthorised possession of the Crèche’s property/equipment;
* Unauthorised use of the Crèche’s property / equipment.
* Failure to account for the Crèche’s property / equipment.
* Any act of dishonesty.
* Failure to follow cash handling procedures. 
* Falsification or being party to falsification of any crèche document or record.
* Disclosure of confidential information.
* Deliberate misconduct likely to result in harm or discomfort to fellow employees, parents, children or members of the public.
* Possession and/or use of non-prescribed drugs or stimulants or alcohol.
* Failure to attend the registered medical practitioner for testing for non prescribed drugs, stimulants or alcohol.
* Failure to allow the Crèche to search the Employee’s personal effects that are on the Crèche’s premises for non-prescribed drugs, stimulants or alcohol.
* Providing false or misleading information or suppressing material facts in the Employee’s application, resume, pre-employment questionnaire or at the formal interview(s).
* Harassing or discriminatory behaviour.
* Breach of computer/internet policy.
* Being under the influence of drugs or alcohol.

Where any term(s) of the disciplinary procedures outlined in this policy are inconsistent with those contained in the Employees Collective Agreement and the Employee in question is party to the Collective Agreement, the terms of the Collective Agreement shall override this policy in relation to such term(s). 

PART 3:  EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY 
Crossways Community Crèche is committed to ensuring that employees are treated fairly when making employment related decisions regardless of: 

Race, colour, ethnic or national origin, gender, age, disability, marital or family status, religion, ethical belief, political opinion, involvement in union advocacy, sexual orientation, health status, and any other factors that are not related to individual ability, job performance and potential to develop in the workplace.

Employment related decisions include those concerning selection, training, development, terms of employment, conditions of work, dismissal and disciplinary action.

Any vacant positions within Crossways Community Crèche must be filled by the most appropriate person available. 

All employees are to be appraised and promoted on the basis of annual performance assessments by both the Crossways Community Crèche and the employee; these will determine the employee’s potential to handle greater responsibility as well as their willingness to do so.  

Crossways Community Crèche shall endeavour to maintain a workplace which is free from harassment and discrimination.

All other personnel policies, activities and other aspects of employment such as selection, training, development, and all other terms and conditions of employment are based only on factors relevant to the job, such as skills, qualifications, abilities and aptitude.   

Any questions or concerns staff have in regard to equal opportunity should in the first instance be directed in confidence to the Staff Liaison Officer or the Licensee, Crossways Community Crèche.  All issues will be discussed with the Management Committee or a sub-committee (at the discretion of the Licensee) before further communications are made.
