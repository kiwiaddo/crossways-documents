**Rationale: **(why do we need this policy?)

To ensure a sensitive and transparent approach is taken to investigating complaints about all aspects of the operation of the Crèche including non-compliance with the Education (Early Childhood Services) Regulations 2008 and associated licensing criteria.





**Objectives: **(What do we hope to achieve?)

To ensure the procedures for making a complaint are inclusive, equitable and culturally appropriate for the Crossways Community Crèche community.





**Guidelines:** (How will we achieve it?)

* All complaints will be handled confidentially.
* Each complaint must be considered separately.
* Outside assistance will be sought as appropriate with agreement of the parties to resolve issues (e.g. union, mediation).
* A copy of this policy is contained in the enrolment information provided to all parents and in the Crèche policy folder. It is also displayed on the main notice board adjacent to the policy folder.
* If a member of staff has a complaint about a procedure or another staff member, the Co-ordinator or Supervisor should be advised of the complaint.
* If a parent/guardian or caregiver has a complaint, the Co-ordinator or Supervisor should be advised of the complaint.
* If the complaint relates to a staff member they will also be informed about the complaint.
* The Supervisor or Co-ordinator will set up a meeting with all affected people to discuss the complaint.
* A record of the meeting will be taken and kept off-site in a confidential management file by the Co-ordinator, with a further copy being provided to the complainant(s).
* Complaints will be noted at committee meetings under correspondence. Any complaints relating to staff will need to be dealt with appropriate privacy.
* All affected people will have the opportunity to speak and to have support people present.
* Agreement should be reached to resolve the complaint. If no agreement can be reached then outside mediation will be sought.
* In the event that a complaint is lodged, a review of relevant practices will take place, and changes made and documented as necessary. The Supervisor or Co-ordinator will lead the review.
* Parents and/or caregivers are entitled to contact the Ministry of Education if they have concerns regarding non-compliance with the Education (Early Childhood Services) Regulations 2008 and associated licensing criteria.
