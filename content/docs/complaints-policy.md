**Rationale:** (why do we need this policy?)

To ensure we can act on feedback and concerns constructively.

To ensure a sensitive and transparent approach is taken to investigating complaints about all aspects of the operation, including non-compliance with the Education (Early Childhood Services) Regulations 2008 and associated licensing criteria.

To ensure we follow current employment legislation and best practice for employers, in addition to the requirements of the collective agreement in place for our staff.

\
**Objectives:** (What do we hope to achieve?)

1. To ensure the procedures for making a complaint are inclusive, equitable, fair, free from bias, and culturally appropriate for the Crossways Community Crèche community.
2. To resolve complaints to the satisfaction of all parties, wherever possible.
3. To document and act on constructive feedback in a clear way.

**Glossary**

**Feedback** is information that is shared on a crèche process, event, policy or other topic. Feedback can be either positive or negative.

**A concern** is any low-level query or statement by a parent/caregiver, employee or other individual which relates to an employee, a teaching or management practice or decision, or other aspect of the service’s policies or operations. This is most likely to be resolved by discussion, clarification, information or very low-level corrective measures only – not disciplinary action.

**A complaint** is a more serious statement made by a parent/caregiver, employee or other individual which relates to an employee, a professional or management practice or decision, or other aspect of the service’s policies or operations that has not met that person’s expectations for some reason.

**Guidelines:** (How will we achieve it?)
We will: 

1. Keep a copy of this policy in the enrolment information provided to all parents and in the crèche policy folder. We will also display it on the main notice board next to the policy folder.
   In responding to concerns and complaints, we will: 
2. Endeavour to communicate directly – kanohi ki te kanohi (face to face) rather than in writing or by phone, unless it is the stated preference of the complainant not to do so. 
3. Ensure any concern or complaint received will be listened to, acknowledged, investigated and followed up in a timely fashion.
4. Endeavour to clearly understand concerns raised and agree with the person raising the concern whether they have raised a:
   a.	low level concern or a 
   b.	complaint
5. Commit to low key resolution wherever we can – discussion, coaching, counselling, rather than discipline.
6. Commit to supportive action – the focus is on positive resolution, not punishment.
7. Consider and preserve confidentiality, to the extent it is possible to do so within the limits of investigating a concern or complaint. 
8. Take reasonable steps to preserve interpersonal and working relationships. 
9. Respect the dignity and mana of the employee (where relevant) and the complainant. 
10. Keep to agreements. 
11. Be impartial.
12. Consider each complaint separately.
13. Seek outside assistance as appropriate with agreement of the parties to resolve issues eg, union, mediation.
