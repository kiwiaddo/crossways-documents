**Rationale:** (why do we need this policy?)

Crossways Community Creche, Early Learning Centre has a duty of care to uphold the safety and wellbeing of children while they are sleeping or resting. We understand that each child has their own routines and patterns for sleep and resting, and believe their wellbeing is maintained when we respond to each child’s unique needs and preferences.



**Objectives:** (What do we hope to achieve?)

To ensure children experience a consistent, comfortable and peaceful sleep/resting environment.

To ensure that there is a system in place to monitor sleeping/ resting children which ensures their, safety and wellbeing.

Provide sleep environments and routines that are safe and protect children from harm. 



**Guidelines:** (How will we achieve it?)



Wellbeing

Teachers are guided by children’s individual rhythms and routines and will strive to support relaxed and unhurried sleep routines. 

Different values and parenting beliefs, cultural or otherwise that are associated with rest and sleeping will help guide our practices in meeting individual needs.  

Environment

A dedicated space is available specifically for under-2s to have a restful sleep at any time, along with a safe and comfortable place to nap or rest within the main activity room for older children.

Health and safety 

All children are provided with their own individual sleeping space and bed linen. 

Sleep procedures and sleep equipment will take into account current health and safety advice from recognised health and safety authorities.

When not in use, furniture or bedding used for children to sleep on will be stored safely to minimise risk of harm, and hygienically in order to prevent cross-infection.   

In accordance with the government regulations, children will not have access to food or liquids while in bed.

Our health hygiene and safety practices will reflect kawa that respects tapu and noa concepts connected with the tapu nature of the head. 

Tapu - 'restricted, sacred, not to be touched, to be avoided 

Noa  - free from restriction, safe from tapu,  non-sacred



Furniture intended for sleeping on is made of or securely covered by non-porous material so liquid cannot pass through thus protecting from soiling and allowing for easy cleaning.

Adults will have clear access to at least one side (meaning the length, not the width); the area surrounding each child allows sufficient air movement to minimise the risk of spreading illness; and children able to sit or stand can do so safely as they wake. \[HS10]

Monitoring

Staff are responsible for setting up the beds and monitoring children who are sleeping. 

A sound, accurate monitoring system is held in place by teachers at all times. Children will be checked for warmth, breathing and general well-being at least every five to ten minutes or more frequently according to individual needs. 

The procedure for monitoring children’s sleep will be displayed near the sleeping room and shared with parents on enrolment, as part of the induction process. 

Parents, guardians and caregivers of children will be advised on collection of their child at the end of session that they have slept.

A chart will be kept adjacent to sleep areas, recording the time each child goes to sleep and the time each child wakes, along with the check times recorded and signed by the checking teacher.
