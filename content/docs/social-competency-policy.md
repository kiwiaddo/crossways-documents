**Rationale:** (why do we need this policy?)



Children develop in a warm, caring and secure environment that promotes and reinforces positive behaviour and which also acknowledges individual differences.  Every child is given respect and dignity. 

TE WHĀRIKI

Belonging - Goal 4: Children experience an environment where they know the limits and boundaries of acceptable behaviour.



**Objectives:** (What do we hope to achieve?)

Children will be provided with opportunities to learn to value themselves, those around them and their environment.  Children and staff will work together to develop effective social competence skills so that all persons at the centre feel valued and respected. Educators will always encourage children to share their feelings, communicate, listen, take-turns.  The importance of teina/tuakana - the older staff and children will take care of the younger staff and children and the younger staff and children will respect the older staff and children at all times. 



**Guidelines:** (How will we achieve it?)



SOCIAL COMPETENCE PRACTICES



The children receive frequent praise and encouragement for appropriate and positive behaviour, assisting to develop their self-esteem.



Teachers’ role model with positive actions to children, parents and each other.



Children should be encouraged to be confident in their own culture and encouraged to understand and respect other cultures. 



Clear guidelines and limits are established and explained to the children.  The teachers apply these in a warm and caring but resolute and consistent manner.



The children are encouraged to resolve their conflicts peacefully.  Teachers will encourage children to verbalise their dislike of a situation.  Having regard to the child’s stage of development, guidance is given, situations are talked through and the children are encouraged to suggest appropriate resolutions.  



Specific language will be used at all times and comments will be phrased positively whenever possible.



The children are encouraged to make their own decisions within these guidelines and limits.  Teachers firmly believe that the children learn best when they are aware they are making these decisions and that they are also responsible for them.



Inappropriate (negative) behaviour, while not being reinforced, is not dwelled upon and receives little attention.  Redirection is used to modify child behaviour.



When repeated inappropriate behaviour occurs – children are reminded of the boundaries of acceptable behaviour and are removed from the area temporarily.  Children are able to return when they choose the understanding that the “problem” behaviour is not repeated.



In situations of repeated negative behaviour, or where negative behaviour occurs out of character, the teachers will inform the parents.  If the behaviour continues, parents would be involved in the development of a positive guidance plan.  





Teachers do not use a belittling or humiliating manner with the children.





Children are given guidance and control; but no child receiving guidance and control is subjected to any form of physical ill-treatment, solitary confinement, immobilization, or deprivation of food, drink, warmth, shelter or protection. No physical punishment is to be used by any person in or at the crèche.  





If any parents/caregivers/guardians have concerns about the behaviour of another child (not their own child), they must raise those with the Supervisor rather than act themselves.  The Supervisor will give due consideration to any issues raised in a timely fashion.  Teachers will involve the child’s parents/caregivers/ guardians fully in discussions and any decisions made.  



Refer to the Complaints Policy for details on how a formal complaint can be made and resolved.



If parents/caregivers/or guardians see children behaving in a way which may result in harm either to themselves or others, they should intervene to prevent such an occurrence, and alert the teachers as soon as possible.
