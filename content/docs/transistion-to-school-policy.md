**Rationale** _(why do we need this policy?)_

At the centre we recognise that primary school learning environments are quite different to early childhood settings. Our aim is to prepare children emotionally, socially, cognitively, and physically for school. We aim to empower children with a love of learning so that the transition from the centre to primary school is as smooth as possible.

TE WHĀRIKI

Contribution - Goal 3: Children experience an environment where they are encouraged to

learn with and alongside others.

**Objectives** _(What do we hope to achieve?)_

To ensure children attending Crossways Community Crèche are prepared for and experience a smooth transition to school.

To reassure parents and children that going to school is a pleasant, normal and natural transition.

**Guidelines** _(How will we achieve it?)_

Discussions are held with the children about going to school in a positive and reassuring manner.  

Children's books with school as their theme are used to assist the staff in their discussions.

Parents are encouraged to visit the schools available to them after their child's fourth birthday.  Parents are advised to review the schools Education Review Office reports to assist them make a decision.  These are available on-line at: <http://www.ero.govt.nz/review-reports/>

Parents are encouraged to make contact with their chosen school before their child's fifth birthday.  

Parents are encouraged to take their child for several visits before starting school, preferably at different times during school hours including when children need to be more independent such as lunchtimes.  Parents are also encouraged to spend time in the playground during the weekend, prior to starting school.
