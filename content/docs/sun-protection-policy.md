**Rationale:** (why do we need this policy?)

Children and adults at Crossways Community Creche need protection against the damaging effects of the sun. The centre is mindful of the Cancer Society message “Slip, slop, slap and wrap”.



TE WHĀRIKI

Well-being - Goal 1: Children experience an environment where their health is promoted.



**Objectives:** (What do we hope to achieve?)

To ensure children and adults at Crossways Community Creche experience a sun safe environment.



**Guidelines:** (How will we achieve it?)

The following guidelines will apply to all days between September and April (whether sunny or cloudy) as well as sunny days in other months.



When outside every child must wear a sunhat that protects their face, neck and ears. 

Parents are asked to apply sunscreen to their child/children before arriving at the centre.

Sunscreen will be reapplied before all children go outside after morning tea.

Children who take their sun hats and clothing off will be encouraged to replace them if they go or stay outside. If they decline, they will be advised to remain indoors.

Adults at the centre must consistently model sun safe behaviour.
