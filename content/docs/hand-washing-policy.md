**Rationale:** (why do we need this policy?)

Washing and drying hands well helps stop the spread of infection. Adults need to maintain clean hands and support children to also do so, to ensure children, whanau, staff and others of Crossways Community Crèche experience an environment where their health is promoted.

**Objectives:** (What do we hope to achieve?)

1. To be sure that children, staff and others wash their hands thoroughly
2. To prevent spread of infection
3. Handwashing occurs after using the toilet and before eating and other relevant times throughout the day
4. Children's development towards independent handwashing is encouraged by the teachers

**Guidelines:** (How will we achieve it?)

* Teachers will acknowledge that children don’t always remember to wash their hands and will therefore remind them.
* Soap in a dispenser, running warm water and paper towels will always be available to aid thorough hand hygiene. (Soap dispensers should be thoroughly cleaned and disinfected before they are refilled). 
* Hand sanitisers may be used when soap and water are not available 
* Separate facilities for washing hands should be available in the kitchen, in addition to the sink that is used to prepare food and clean dishes.
* Teachers will regularly role-model the correct way to wash hands, as well as explaining the importance of this.
* Poster demonstrating how to wash hands will be accessible to children.
