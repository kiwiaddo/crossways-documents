**Rationale:** (why do we need this policy?)

Enrolment and admission is the first step in the forming of a new relationship between children, their parents/guardians and whanau to the Crossways Community Crèche. The Crèche has a responsibility to ensure that all relevant legislative and regulatory requirements are met, clear and transparent information about enrolments and admission is provided, and to ensure equitable treatment of children, parents/guardians and whanau.

**Objectives:** (What do we hope to achieve?)

Accurate enrolment records must be kept for each child attending.

Information about Fees charged by the Crèche will be easily accessible by parents/guardians and whanau.

Clear guidance around the waiting list, the booking of sessions and the notice period for withdrawals enables us to plan and keep a full roll and therefore receive maximum bulk funding.

**Guidelines:** (How will we achieve it?)

Introduction to crèche
* Parents and children are introduced to the crèche by way of general perusal of crèche facilities.
* Crèche procedures and expectations are consistently relayed to all families. Key information (e.g. parent help requirements) is provided both verbally and in a written form. An enrolment information pack summarising the most important procedures and expectations is given to all parents on accepting a position at the crèche.
Parents are required to acknowledge that they have received such a document, and agree to its provisions,
before their child can attend unaccompanied by an authorised caregiver. A follow-up summary is given to all parents once the child has completed their settling in sessions or approximately one month after joining.

Settling in
* Parents or caregivers must bring their child to a minimum of one and a maximum of four settling in sessions
before they start their first paid session. Parents must remain with their child at these times. Settling in sessions can be used in the two weeks before the first paid session. The Senior Teacher will inform parents of the date of the first paid session. If a settling in session is missed due to illness, the parent/caregiver may attend an alternative settling in session as long as it is completed within the two weeks before the first paid session is due. This is a requirement of the bulk funding system.
* It is expected that your child will have settling days which include their intended day(s) of attendance if at all possible. This allows the child a chance to get to know the other children on session. Please liaise with the Booking Officer regarding the nominated dates of your settling session in advance.

Admissions:
* Admissions will be based on children 1 to 5 years of age. There are twenty spaces available daily.
* Parents will be advised to enrol their children early by initially liaising with the Crèche Booking Officer who will
coordinate the child&#39;s attendances with availability of sessions.
* Parents will be notified of the date of the first paid session as spaces become available. Settling-in sessions are
available in the two weeks before this as outlined below.

Waiting list
* The waiting list operates on a first come, first served basis subject to the discretion of the Senior Teacher and
the following guidelines:
* Existing children shall be given preference to attend a second session (because children settle in more
quickly when they attend for two sessions).
* Every effort will be made to hold three places per session for under-two year olds. This means that
when spaces become available, under-two children will be prioritised to maintain this number.
* The Senior Teacher is required to monitor and organise daily attendance to ensure a positive and
manageable social environment (i.e. gender and age mix). The Senior Teacher will liaise with the
Booking Officer to confirm suitable placements for attendance sessions.

Permanent booked sessions
* Booked permanent sessions are for 2-5 sessions per week and are booked in advance with the Booking Officer.
All newly enrolled children must be booked for a minimum of two sessions a week.
* All booked sessions must be paid for two weeks in advance whether the child attends or not. Automatic
payments are to be used as the method of payment unless other arrangements are agreed upon with the Billing
Officer prior to commencement. Every two months an invoice will be sent to parents summarising the charges
and payments over the billing period and the current balance of their Crèche account.
* Children must only be enrolled at one childcare facility at any one time (they cannot be enrolled at two places on the same day/time). Children should be enrolled for times they can regularly attend. This is required to receive the maximum bulk funding allowed.
* The Crèche reserves the right to offer a child's place to other families if the child is absent for more than three weeks. (Absence beyond this time will reduce the amount the Crèche receives through bulk funding.)

Casual sessions

* Casual spaces may be available on some days to children already attending the Crèche (i.e. they have
already settled in and have booked sessions) or are previous students of the Creche. Accepting casual
attendees is at the sole discretion of the teachers. Parents wishing to book children for casual sessions
should make a request with the Senior Teacher who will confirm availability and booking of sessions.
* If a child is not booked in for a casual space and one becomes available the Senior Teacher will advise all families as soon as possible via email or phone depending on the notice given by the non-attending family.
The space will be given to the first family to respond.

Fees
* We have an $80 enrolment fee for all new admissions.
* The enrolment fee is inclusive of a one-off Civil Defence levy will be charged for all new admissions. This is to stock the Civil Defence kit that we supply for all adults and children. The amount for this is currently set
at $30
* In order to provide Crossway Community Crèche’s unique type of education and care through smaller
session sizes, and high teacher to child ratios, the Crèche requests that parents/guardians make a
contribution to enable it to meet the extra expense this incurs. The current contribution for children
participating in the free ECE scheme is $15 per session.
* The current fee for casual sessions is $35.00 per session.
Leaving the Crèche
* Families must give written notice to the Senior Teacher that a child is leaving the Crèche a minimum of four weeks prior to the child&#39;s proposed last day. Fees are payable for the entire four week notice period, even if the child's final day at the Crèche is less than four weeks after notice is given. The Senior Teacher will sign off and confirm the child's last day with the family.
