**Rationale:** (why do we need this policy?)

Enrolment and admission are the first steps in the forming of a new relationship between children, their parents/guardians and whānau with the Crossways Community Crèche. The crèche has a responsibility to ensure that: 

* all relevant legislative and regulatory requirements are met;
* clear and transparent information about enrolments and admission is provided; and 
* there is equitable treatment of children, parents/guardians and whānau.

**Objectives:** (What do we hope to achieve?)

1. Accurate enrolment records must be kept for each child attending. 
2. Information about fees charged by the crèche will be easily accessible by parents/guardians and whānau.
3. Clear guidance around the enrolment waiting list, the booking of sessions and the notice period for withdrawals enables us to plan and keep a full roll and therefore receive maximum bulk funding.

**Guidelines:** (How will we achieve it?)

**General inquiries**

* General information about Crossways is available: 

  * on our website 
  * in an information pamphlet 
  * by emailing info@crosswayscreche.org.nz 
  * by phone contact (noting teachers have limited availability during operating hours for phone enquiries)
* Visits can be booked with the head delegate or their delegate. The most suitable time for visiting is between 9.30 and 11.30am. Time is allowed for visitors to observe the centre in operation, meet and speak with the teachers, observe the curriculum in action, and speak with other Crossways parents.
* Key information is shared both verbally and in writing (in the information pamphlet and on the website): 

  * the philosophy
  * parent contribution to the operation of the centre 
  * fees 
  * curriculum information
  * hours of operation
* a record is kept of waiting list enquiries, including child’s name and age, parent/caregiver names, preferred days, and contact details.

**Admissions** 

* There are 22 spaces available each weekday (with up to five spaces per day for under-2s).
* We welcome applications for enrolment of children aged 1 year to 5 years. 
* We ask that children are booked in for a minimum of two sessions a week as this continuity supports children to build secure, trusting relationships with the teachers and other children.
* We provide:

  * a short session (8.30am - 1pm) a long session (8.30am - 2.30pm), for children aged 2 years and older. Children under 2 years may attend the long session at the head teacher’s discretion

**Applying to enrol at Crossways**

**Waiting list**

* The waiting list operates on a first come, first served basis, subject to the discretion of the head teacher, and the following guidelines:

  * children already attending Crossways will be given preference to attend additional session/s
  * every effort will be made to hold three places per session for under-two year olds 
  * the senior teacher/head teacher is required to monitor and organise daily attendance to ensure a positive and manageable environment, balancing group dynamics, ages, and centre needs
* Places become available when another child leaves for school or other reasons. Waiting list times can be unpredictable and parents are advised to check back periodically to register their continuing interest.
* Crossways will check periodically to ensure waiting list applications remain current.

**Enrolment at Crossways**

* Enrolment offers are made in writing (email) to the parent/guardian and must be accepted and taken up by the stated dates.
* If the enrolment date offered is not suitable to the parent/guardian, they can choose to remain on the waiting list until the next space becomes available.
* On accepting a placement, a non-refundable enrolment fee must be paid to confirm enrolment.
* An enrolment form must be completed and signed by both the child’s parent / guardian and the head teacher on behalf of the centre. The enrolment form must contain all information required by the Ministry of Education. 
* The parent/guardian must supply: 

  * one form of identification for their child for a teacher to sight and copy
  * a record of the child’s current vaccinations to date
* The enrolling parent/guardian must have the opportunity to access all policies. Policies are available on our website and in hard copy at the centre.
* All enrolment documentation requirements must be completed prior to a child officially starting.
* Enrolment information (both verbal and written) summarising the most important procedures and expectations should be shared with parents/guardians before the child starts.

**The transition pathway to Crossways**

* Parents/caregivers must visit with their child a minimum of four times before their official starting date. Settling visits should begin a minimum of two weeks before the official starting date.
* The first four settling visits are at no cost. Additional paid settling visits can be arranged by agreement with the Senior Teacher. The Senior Teacher will inform parents of the date of the first paid session.
* During settling visits, the parent/caregiver stays with their child for the majority of the time, helping them become familiar with the centre environment and routines, and beginning to build relationships with the teachers and community.
* A key teacher will support both the child and their parent/caregiver in their orientation to the centre and act as the child’s primary caregiver at creche.
* Parents are encouraged to raise any queries or concerns so the key teacher can support them and their child through the settling-in process and beyond.
* Together with the teachers, it will be decided at what point during settling visits the parent/caregiver should leave and for how long. In general, parents can consider venturing out for a short time on the third visit.
* It is expected that children will have settling in visits which include their intended days of attendance if possible.

**Attendance**

* Permanent sessions are for two to five sessions per week and are booked in advance with the Booking Officer.  All newly enrolled children must be booked for a minimum of two sessions a week. 
* Children should be enrolled for times they can regularly attend. They should not be enrolled at another childcare facility for the same days/times.
* Crossways reserves the right to offer a child's place to other families if the child is absent for more than three weeks. 
* Changes to the bookings must be advised in writing and should be at least two weeks in advance of the proposed change taking effect.
* Children who turn five while enrolled at the centre are welcome to remain enrolled and attend Crossways until they start school.
  Casual sessions
* Casual spaces may be available to children already enrolled if spaces are available. 
* To book children for casual sessions, a request should be made with the head teacher or their delegate, who will confirm availability and booking of sessions.

**Fees**

* We have a non-refundable enrolment fee of $150 for all new admissions, which is payable on confirmed enrolment.
* The enrolment fee is inclusive of a one-off Civil Defence levy which will be charged for all new admissions.
* Fees are payable in advance, and the first payment of 2 weeks must be paid in full before starting (in addition to the one-off enrolment administration fee).

  * All booked sessions must be paid for two weeks in advance (whether the child ends up attending or not). 
    Automatic payments are to be used as the method of payment unless other arrangements are agreed upon with the Billing Officer prior to commencement.
  * Every two months an invoice will be sent to parents/caregivers summarising the charges and payments over the billing period and the current balance of their crèche account. 
* Late or non-payment of fees: accounts outstanding for more than a fortnight may result in a loss of booking. By enrolling at the centre, parents agree to pay all costs incurred in the collection of any outstanding debts (including legal costs, court fees and debt collection commissions).
* For children three years and over: 

  * All children over 3 years of age are eligible for 20 hours free ECE funding

    In order to meet the expense of providing Crossway Community Crèche’s unique type of education and care through smaller session sizes, and high teacher-to-child ratios, the crèche requests that parents/guardians make a contribution (in addition to the listed fees). The current requested contribution for children participating in the free ECE scheme is listed in the appendix.
* Children attending outside of the ECE scheme, on a casual basis or being under three will be charged the full attendance fee (see appendix).
* A government Childcare Subsidy administered by Work and Income is also available - parents/caregivers should check their eligibility by calling 0800 559 009 or at https://www.workandincome.govt.nz/products/a-z-benefits/childcare-subsidy.html 

**Giving notice of leaving Crossways by ending enrolment**

* Families are required to provide at least four weeks’ notice (in writing) that a child will permanently leave the centre. Fees are payable for the entire four week notice period.

Appendix 2: *MINISTRY OF EDUCATION FUNDING: Ministry of Education funding rules we follow:
The Ministry funds each child for a maximum of 6 hours a day.*

*a)  There must be evidence that the parent/guardian has regularly examined and confirmed the attendance roll by signing in and out each day of attendance*

*b)  **Three week absence:** from the first day of absence, funding can be claimed for all absences that occur in a twenty-one day calendar period. If the child is absent on the 22nd day from the first absence, the centre will not be able to claim funding until the booking is resumed.*

*c)  **The frequent absence rule:** A child’s attendance must match their enrolment for at least 50 per cent of each calendar month, e.g:*

1. *when a child is absent on the same enrolled day for more than halt of these days in a calendar month or*
2. *when a child attends for fewer days per week than they are enrolled to attend, in more than half the weeks in a calendar month, or*
3. *a child attends for fewer hours than they are enrolled to attend, on a daily basis, on more than half of their enrolled days in a calendar month*

**If a child is absent from the centre for more than 21 days, or does not meet their booked hours consistently, parents may be required to pay for any funding loss incurred.**
