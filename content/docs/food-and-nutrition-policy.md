**Rationale:** (why do we need this policy?)

Crossways Community Creche encourages a healthy eating environment and culture in our centres. We consider that healthy food and beverage choices can enhance educational outcomes for our children. 

TE WHĀRIKI

Well-being - Goal 1: Children experience an environment where their health is promoted.



**Procedures: **

Only staff and other adults have access to the kitchen facilities.

Staff and parent help will wash their hands prior to preparing morning tea.  A reminder is displayed in the kitchen above the sink.

All children will be offered water at both morning tea and lunch times.

Food should be stored in the fridge as appropriate and fruit washed prior to consumption.

Children should be supervised while eating.

Children should be seated whilst eating and drinking and they should be encouraged not to share food.

Healthy eating is encouraged and sweets are not to be included in lunches.

A food record is to be kept in the kitchen of what the children eat that is supplied by crèche staff.  This record is to be kept for three months.

Parents/whanau will be notified of any allergies that children at the creche have, and which foods not to bring to Creche.

Breastfeeding

The Crèche is supportive of breastfeeding, and will provide a quiet space at Crèche for mothers to breast feed if they wish to do so.
