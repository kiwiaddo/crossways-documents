**Rationale:** (why do we need this policy?)

Crossways Community Crèche, Early Learning Centre believes that children need to live and learn in an environment where their rights are promoted. We have an obligation to ensure the wellbeing of children in our care and are committed to the prevention of child abuse and neglect and to the ongoing protection of all children.

**Objectives:** (What do we hope to achieve?)

To provide a safe environment, free from physical, emotional, verbal or sexual abuse in which children’s vulnerability is recognised and they are protected at all times.

To recognise the important role and responsibility we have in the protection of children by identifying and responding to suspected child abuse or neglect in a timely and appropriate way.

To uphold the safety and wellbeing of the child as paramount when investigating suspected or alleged abuse.

To support families/whānau to protect their children.

**Guidelines:** (How will we achieve it?)

>Definition: Child abuse: Includes physical, emotional and sexual abuse as well as neglect which is the direct
consequence of a deliberate act or omission by an adult and which has the potential or effect of serious harm to the child.

Recruitment and employment (safety checking)

Safety checking will apply to the following:
* New and existing employees
* Students on practicum
* Relievers
* Volunteers
Safety checking will be carried out in accordance with the Vulnerable Children Act 2014 (VCA). This will include:
* A police vet; identity verification; references and an interview.
* A work history will be sought and previous employers will be contacted.
* If there is any suspicion that an applicant might pose a risk to a child, that applicant will not be employed.

Results of safety checks must be obtained before the worker has access to children

Safety checks should be carried out every three years. 

Safety checks may be carried out by Crossways Community

Crèche Early Learning Centre or another person or organisation acting on their behalf.

**Staff Training**

Training, resources and/or advice will be available to ensure that all staff can carry out their roles in terms of this policy, particularly:

* Understanding child abuse and indicators of child abuse.
* How to reduce the risk of child abuse.
* Understanding and complying with legal obligations in regard to child abuse.
* Working with outside agencies on child abuse issues.
* Planning of environment and supervision to minimise risk.
* Dealing with child/parents/family/whānau. This policy will be part of the initial staff induction programme.

**Supervision and prevention**

Staff and other adults will remain readily visible at all times when with children.

Only teachers or the child’s own parent/caregiver are allowed to toilet, bath or change nappies of children.

Teachers will direct parents and visitors as to what they can and cannot do while on the premises in respect of this policy.

Children will have the opportunity to engage with curriculum which teaches the nature of personal safety and wellbeing, their rights to personal safety, help seeking and self-protecting behaviours and their responsibilities to the safety and wellbeing of others.

Teachers will be vigilant to where children are in the environment.

No person using, or under the influence of alcohol, or any other substances that has a detrimental effect on their functioning or behaviour will be allowed on the premises during its hours of operation.

All practicable steps will be taken to protect children from exposure to inappropriate material (for example, of an explicitly sexual or violent nature).

**Identifying possible abuse or neglect**

We have a commitment to make sure that all staff whose work involves contact with children are able to identify the signs of potential abuse and neglect and respond appropriately.

The interagency guide “Working together to keep children and young people safe” (Child, Youth and Family, Feb 2011) provides a reference for us in identifying signs and symptoms of possible abuse or neglect and an assessment framework to support our decision making processes.

Teachers will be aware of the indicators of potential abuse and recognise a clusters of these signs that may indicate risk, including:
* Physical signs
* Behavioural concerns
* Developmental delays
*  Child disclosure
* Physical neglect
* Neglectful supervision
* Medical neglect
* Abandonment

**Responding to suspected abuse or neglect**

If there is cause to suspect child abuse, the first obligation is to ensure the child is in no immediate danger. The Police should be contacted if the child is in immediate danger.

All suspicions or observed incidents or reports of incidents should be reported directly to the most senior teacher on duty/Chairperson of the committee as soon as possible.

Our “Child Abuse Reporting Process” will follow the guidelines outlined in Safer Organisations, Safer Children (2015) Pg 28, 54

If there is clear evidence or reasonable cause to believe an instance of child abuse having taken place we will support the roles of the New Zealand Police (the Police) and the Child, Youth and Family Service (CYF) in the investigation of suspected abuse and will report suspected/alleged abuse to these agencies.

Full and detailed written records will be kept of every related discussion or act or incident from the first instance child abuse is suspected.

Child disclosure of abuse will be treated seriously and responded to using guidance outlined in Safer Organisations,

Safer children (Feb 2015) “Responding to a child when the child discloses abuse”, Pg 27. Our “Child Disclosure of Abuse Process” will follow these guidelines.

**Confidentiality and information sharing**

Concerns about suspected abuse and neglect, must be handled in a way that respects individual privacy.

The Privacy Act 1993 and the Children, Young Persons, and Their Families Act 1989 (CYPF Act) says that information can be shared to keep children safe when abuse or suspected abuse is reported or investigated.

**Allegations or concerns about an employee**

As an employer we recognise there is a dual responsibility in respect of both the child and the employee. We will follow a prompt and fair process that complies with all relevant moral and legal obligations. 

Addressing the needs of the child will remain the first priority.

The decision to follow up on an allegation of suspected abuse or neglect against an employee will be made in
consultation with CYF and the Police.

If, after discussion with CYF and/or the Police, there is a need to pursue an allegation as an employment matter, we will advise the person concerned that they have a right to seek legal advice and provide them with an opportunity to respond.

The person should be informed of their right to seek support from the relevant union/representative body.

We will follow our disciplinary procedures, be guided by the employment contracts/collective employment contract and relevant statutory obligations.

We commit not to use ‘settlement agreements’, where the conduct at issue concerns the safety or wellbeing of a child, use of such agreements is contrary to a culture of child protection.

**Policy Review**

This policy will be reviewed at least every three years
