**Rationale:** (why do we need this policy?)

At Crossways Community Creche, Early Learning Centre we are constantly reviewing and improving our teaching, management, environments and practices. Internal Evaluation is a process through which early childhood education services engage in critical inquiry in order to evaluate the effectiveness of what they do, with the aim of improvement and innovation. Parents should be consulted and informed on all aspects of their child's education 



 

**Objectives:** (What do we hope to achieve?)

At its heart, effective internal evaluation is about improving children’s outcomes.



The purpose of conducting internal evaluation is to:



identify and address areas for improvement

meet accountability requirements

create knowledge about what works, for which children and why.



Learners are the focus of inquiry and evaluation processes.





**Guidelines:** (How will we achieve it?)

Self-review as an evaluative process should be primarily concerned with impact on children’s learning and development, using the principles, strands, goals and learning outcomes of Te Whāriki as a framework, together with the identified learning priorities of the kaiako, children, parents, whānau and communities. 

 

Internal evaluation involves:

•     asking good questions

•     gathering fit-for-purpose data and information

•     making sense of that information

•     prioritising actions for improvement

•     monitoring and evaluating the impact of specific improvement actions.

Planned and spontaneous evaluation is regular and ongoing, there is clear documentation evidencing self-reviews undertaken and it is available to the community and others.  

 

Evaluation may focus on the teaching and learning programme, priorities for learning, or other elements of practice delivery, directly impacting learning and teaching. It will ask: What is working well, and for whom? What needs to change, and how?

 

Roles

Kaiako discuss, reflect upon and evaluate how effectively the curriculum planning and implementation is supporting children’s learning interests and progress.

 

Committee discuss, reflect upon and evaluate how effectively the centre frameworks, consultation and strategic planning is supporting quality outcomes for children.

The perspectives of managers, educators, children, parents and whanau should be included in all review.
