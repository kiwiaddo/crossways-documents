**Rationale:** (why do we need this policy?)

Crossways recognises the importance of encouraging healthy sun exposure, balancing this with the need for protection against the damaging effects of the sun.

Excessive exposure to the ultra-violet radiation (UV radiation) from the sun may cause sunburn and damage the skin, which increases the risk of skin cancer. Children engaged in play and learning experiences outside may have increased exposure to UV radiation.

Vitamin D is an essential nutrient made in the body when skin is exposed to sunlight. But, because of the risks of sunburn and skin cancer, mindfulness is required to remain sun-safe. 

**Objectives:** (What do we hope to achieve?)

1. To allow for healthy sun exposure while protecting children against the damaging effects of the sun
2. To encourage responsible decision-making about sun exposure and protection
3. To encourage awareness of skin and eye damage and practical means of protection from UV radiation 
4. To encourage children, parents and staff to wear appropriate hats and clothing for outdoor activities
5. To work towards an environment that provides shade for children, parents and staff

**Guidelines:** (How will we achieve it?)

The following strategies will ensure children and adults experience a sun safe environment while attending Crossways:

1. Crossways will follow the Cancer Society [sun protection strategies](https://wellington.cancernz.org.nz/reducing-cancer-risk/what-you-can-do/sunsmart/sun-protection/?divisionId=22) “Slip, slop, slap and wrap”.
2. At the time of enrolment, parents will be informed of the sun-safe policy and procedures.
3. Parents will be encouraged to send children with appropriate clothing and, if they like, sunglasses, including    at the time of enrolment and through an annual email at the start of the period when sun protection strategies will apply.
4. Sun protection strategies will apply: September to April, between 10am and 4pm, and when the UV Index (UVI) is 3 or above.
5. Opportunities will be provided through staff professional development and children’s activities, for both staff    and children to learn about sun protection.
6. When planning learning/play opportunities in the outside environment, at the centre or on excursions in the local community, Kaiako will be mindful of sun safety, by assessing and managing risk from sun exposure. 
7. Sun-safe and shaded areas will be utilised, to ensure children have access to shaded play, living and learning spaces.
8. Sensible sun exposure allows for the body to develop vitamin D, while avoiding getting sunburnt. Sunsmart advises that exposure to sunlight when UV levels are low should provide enough vitamin D for keeping healthy.
