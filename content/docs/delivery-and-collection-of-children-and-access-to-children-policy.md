**Rationale:** (why do we need this policy?)

The centre has a responsibility to ensure that the welfare and care of the children is protected including:

* children are safely delivered to and collected from the centre.
* caregivers have appropriate access to their children.

**Objectives:** (what do we hope to achieve?)

* To ensure the safe delivery and collection of children attending the centre
* To ensure the centre is meeting its duty of care obligations under the law
* To provide a welcoming environment to children and families

**Guidelines:** (how will we achieve it?)

**Delivery and Collection of Children**

1. Teachers are responsible for children only within the confines of the Centre grounds, on approved outings or excursions, or during an emergency evacuation.
2. Parents/whānau/caregivers are responsible for their children whilst proceeding to and from the centre and outside session hours.
3. The operating hours of the centre are from 8:30 am until 2.30 pm.  Parents/whanau/caregivers are expected to deliver and collect children within these hours.  Those who repeatedly extend these hours will be cautioned.  
4. The parent/caregiver must sign the attendance register and record the time of the child’s arrival and departure.
5. Two teachers should remain at the centre until the last child has been collected.  However, in the event that a teacher has had to wait for two hours beyond the pickup time of 2.30 pm, and hasn’t been able to speak with the person(s) nominated as emergency contacts, then the staff member will phone Police and Oranga Tamariki - Ministry for Children

**Access to Children**

1. the enrolment form, records the names of the people authorised to collect the child from the Centre.  Teachers will not release children to anyone else without prior notice from parents/whanau/caregivers.  
2. It also records the names of the people who:
   ●	have custody of a child;
   ●	by law, have a right of access to the child;
   ●	by law, are forbidden to have access to the child;
   ●	by law, have a right of access to the child subject to conditions.
3. It is the responsibility of the parents to inform the Head teacher /staff of custody and access arrangements.  Any relevant documentation should be sighted and copies made and retained for reference.  The Centre is required by law to follow access arrangements defined by law.
4. Non-custodial parents continue to have guardianship rights and are entitled to exercise them.
5. A ‘Custody Order’ of the Court states the rights and terms of access for the non-custodial parent.
6. A ‘Ward of State’ may be placed under guardianship of the Court, but both parents also retain their guardianship rights.
7. Guardians (regardless of custodial rights) are entitled to:
   ●	a copy of any written report/documentation kept/made about the child's development;
   ●	discuss the development of the child with the Head teacher
   ●	contribute to major decisions affecting the child; and
   ●	see any records available to the parents.

The Centre will make reasonable efforts to assist guardians to avail themselves of these rights.  The process by which the above information/communication occurs is detailed in the Communication & Consultation Policy.

8. Teachers, if they have reasonable doubts about the identity, good faith or legal rights of any person wishing to make contact with a child, should consult the parent who is confirmed as the child’s legal guardian.  A person can be asked to produce a copy of the ‘Access Order’ or to give the name of a solicitor to whom an enquiry can be made.
9. Where there is any doubt, unrestricted access to a child should not be allowed, e.g. a teacher stays with the parent and child.
10. The welfare of the child is of prime concern The Centre will avoid becoming involved in disputes between parents over the exercise of their rights in regard to the care and education of their children.  Conflicts must be resolved by the parents and if necessary, by the Court.
