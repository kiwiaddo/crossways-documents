**Rationale:** (why do we need this policy?)

Crossways Community Crèche has a responsibility in protecting the health and wellbeing of children. The Health (Immunisation) Regulations 1995 require all early childhood services to keep an immunisation register. The register is seen as a tool to help reduce the spread of vaccine-preventable diseases in early childhood services, as well as the wider community. Immunisation is not a requirement of enrolment and parents decisions whether or not to immunise their child will be respected. 

**Objectives:** (What do we hope to achieve?)

To minimize the risk, and spread of infectious diseases, between members of our community and beyond. 
To provide quick access to a child’s immunisation status if required by a Medical Officer of Health
To maintain whànau and child’s rights to privacy and show respect for personal beliefs regarding child health. 

Guidelines: (How will we achieve it?)
On enrolment parents will be asked to provide their child’s Immunisation certificate for a teacher to sight and copy. 

The Immunisation certificate can be found on the back page of the Well child – Tamariki Ora health book, it should be viewed on enrolment, at 15 months and 4 years. (A record of immunisation can also be provided by a doctor or practice nurse)    
 
If provided, the child’s Immunisation certificate/record should be copied and filed with their enrolment form.

The information on the child’s Immunisation certificate/record, must be recorded on the Crossways Community Crèche official Immunisation Register.

If after two requests no immunisation information has been provided, this must be recorded as “Certificate not shown”.

The register must be kept in a secure place and information kept confidential.

Parents have the right to view only their child’s recorded immunisation information.

Only the Medical Officer of Health may view the information on the register without parental consent.

The Immunisation register may be used by the Medical Officer of Health to identify unimmunised children during an outbreak of a vaccine preventable disease. 

In case of an outbreak of a vaccine preventable disease (except tetanus), teachers and the Medical Officer of Health have the authority to require that the child with the illness remain at home to prevent the spread of infection.

Unimmunised children may be excluded if deemed necessary by the Medical Officer of Health and it is the responsibility of parents and teachers to ensure this is complied with. 

All staff and volunteers are encouraged to ensure their own immunisations are kept up to date.
