**Rationale:** (why do we need this policy?)

Crossways Community Crèche has a responsibility in protecting the health and wellbeing of children. The Health (Immunisation) Regulations 1995 require all early childhood services to keep an immunisation register. The register is seen as a tool to help reduce the spread of vaccine-preventable diseases in early childhood services, as well as the wider community. Immunisation is not a requirement of enrolment and parents’ decisions whether or not to immunise their child will be respected. 

**Objectives:** (What do we hope to achieve?)

* To meet our obligations under the Health (Immunisation) Regulations 1995
* To minimize the risk, and spread of infectious diseases, between members of our community and beyond 
* To provide quick access to a child’s immunisation status if required by a Medical Officer of Health
* To maintain whānau and children’s rights to privacy and show respect for personal beliefs regarding child health. 

**Guidelines:** (How will we achieve it?)

* On enrolment, parents will be asked to provide their child’s Immunisation certificate for a teacher to sight and copy 
* The immunisation record can be found on the back page of the Well child – Tamariki Ora health book. A record of immunisation can also be provided by a doctor or practice nurse

  * The immunisation record should be viewed on enrolment, at 15 months and 4 years.


* The child’s immunisation certificate/record should be copied and filed with their enrolment for
* The information on the child’s immunisation record must be recorded on the Crossways Community Crèche Immunisation Register
* If, after two requests, no immunisation information has been provided, this must be recorded as “Certificate not shown”
* The register must be kept in a secure place so that the information stays confidential
* Parents have the right to view only their child’s recorded immunisation information
* Only the Medical Officer of Health may view the information on the register without parental consent. The Immunisation register may be used by the Medical Officer of Health to identify unimmunised children during an outbreak of a vaccine preventable disease. 

  * A Medical Officer of Heath is a public health physician (doctor) who specialises in the health of groups / communities; they are designated by the Director General of Health


* In case of an outbreak of a vaccine preventable disease (except tetanus), teachers and the Medical Officer of Health have the authority to require that the child with the illness remain at home to prevent the spread of infection.
* Unimmunised children may be excluded from attending the early childhood centre if deemed necessary by the Medical Officer of Health. It is the responsibility of parents and teachers to ensure this is complied with.
* All staff and volunteers are encouraged to ensure their own immunisations are kept up to date.
