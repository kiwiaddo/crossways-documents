**Rationale:** (why do we need this policy?)

Children and adults will experience an environment where they are protected from the harmful effects of smoking.



TE WHĀRIKI

Well-being - Goal 1: Children experience an environment where their health is promoted.



**Objectives:** (What do we hope to achieve?)

This policy endorses the education provisions of the Smoke-free Environments Act 1990 to:

prevent the exposure of children and young people to second-hand smoke;

prevent children and young people being influenced by seeing others smoke;

send a positive message about a smoke-free/auahi kore lifestyle as the norm.



**Guidelines:** (How will we achieve it?)

Smoking is prohibited at all times - 24 hours a day, seven days a week within the buildings or the grounds of the crèche, on crèche excursions and at official crèche socials. 

Smoke-free signs are displayed at all entrances to the crèche premises and at every outer entrance to every building or enclosed area forming part of the crèche premises.

The crèche’s Smoke-free Policy is promoted in the Enrolment Guidelines to ensure new families and caregivers are informed of the policy.

All staff members must report to the Co-ordinator or Supervisor immediately, when they identify any adult, staff member, visitor or child attempting to light or use a cigarette or other device or product that creates smoke in a prohibited area or during a crèche outing/social occasion.

When a ‘smoker’ is attempting to come onto, or is present in a smoke-free area, the Co-ordinator or Supervisor will advise the person that their presence and action is unlawful (‘the Crèche is required by law to be smoke-free’) and if they persist, then they are requested to leave the area immediately and/or put out the cause of the smoke.

The Co-ordinator or Supervisor is responsible for receiving/actioning/resolving complaints.

If the Co-ordinator or Supervisor is unable to resolve the complaint satisfactorily, the complaint will be taken to the Crèche Management Committee for resolution.
