**Rationale:** (why do we need this policy?)

At Crossways Community Crèche the health and safety of each child is paramount.  On occasion we are required to administer medicines to maintain a child’s wellbeing.  At these times we must ensure that all medicines (prescription and non-prescription) are approved for a particular child, administered and stored appropriately and safely, and accurate records are maintained.  

TE WHĀRIKI

Well-being - Goal 1: Children experience an environment where their health is promoted.





**Objectives:** (What do we hope to achieve?)

To ensure medications are administered, with the proper care and a clear understanding of roles and responsibilities.

To ensure parent authorisation requirements are maintained for the different categories of medicines.  

To ensure a record is kept of all prescription and non-prescription medicine given to children when attending the centre, which demonstrates we have fulfilled our duty of care.

To ensure medications are not a hazard to any child’s health.



**Guidelines:** (How will we achieve it?)

Summary

Authorisation

Our centre ensures that all medicines (prescription and non-prescription) are administered appropriately and safely according to the category of medicine (HS28).  Parents are required to provide written authority before any medicine can be administered. (Please see Appendix 1 for a copy of the written authority to administer  category (i), (ii) and (iii) medicines.)

Category (i)

At enrolment parents are asked to provide written authority for the use and preparation of category (i) medicines for the period of their child’s enrollment. Parents will be informed of all category (i) medicines stored and used at the centre. If the list of medicines changes, parents will be notified and consent sought again. (See Appendix 1 for the current list of category (i) medicines administered.)

Category (ii)

A category (ii) medicine will only need to be administered by creche staff for a limited period of time. At the beginning of each day that the category (ii) medicine is needed, the parent must provide written information about the medicine. This will include:

\* what the medicine is called,

\* how it is to be administered (method and dose)

\* when the medicine should be given (including the time of day and in response to specific symptoms/circumstances).

The parent must also sign a form at the start of the day to show they give their consent for the centre to administer the medicine.

When they collect their child at the end of the day they must sign again to acknowledge that the centre has correctly administered the medicine.

Parental permission to administer medications cannot be provided over the phone except in an urgent situation, eg one requiring the administration of inhalers.

Category (iii)

At enrolment written authority from a parent is sought for the use and preparation of category (iii) medicines whilst their child is enrolled at the centre.  The information required includes:

\* how the medication is to be administered (method and dose)

\* when the medication should be administered (including the time of day and specific symptoms/circumstances when the medicine should be given.)

\* Parents and the staff will also develop an individual health plan. Parents are asked to advise staff of any changes to the plan (including medicines) in a timely manner.

\* If a child is prescribed a category (iii) medication whilst already enrolled at creche, the above process will also be followed.



Roles and Responsibilities

A medication register must be maintain recording all medicine (prescription and non-prescription) given to children attending thee service. Records must include:

\* name of the child;

\* name and amount of medicine given; date and time medicine was administered and by whom; and evidence of parental acknowledgement.

Medicine (prescription and non-prescription) will not be given to a child unless it is given:

\* by a doctor or ambulance personnel in an emergency; or

\* by the parent of the child; or

\* with the written authority (appropriate to the category of medicine) of the child’s parent/guardian

Records of who is authorised to administer which medicines will be maintained by the Professional Lead and all staff and relevant parents will be informed.

Only permanent staff members with a current first aid certificate will administer medicines (prescription and non-prescription).

Medicines must be stored safely and appropriately, and disposed of, or sent home with a parent (if supplied in relation to a specific child) after the specified time.  

Adults who administer medicine must be provided with relevant information and training relevant to the task. A record must be kept of information and training provided. 

Adults who administer medicine are required to double check name, expiry date and that medicine is correct dosage.

If after administering a medication staff have any concerns that the child is having an adverse reaction immediate action should be taken. In mild cases, this might involve only contacting the child’s parents.
